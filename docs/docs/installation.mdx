# Installing Tanka

Tanka is distributed as a single binary called `tk`. It already includes the Jsonnet compiler, but requires some tools to be available:

- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/): Tanka
  uses `kubectl` to communicate to your cluster. This means `kubectl` must be
  available somewhere on your `$PATH`. If you ever have worked with Kubernetes
  before, this should be the case anyways.
- `diff`: To compute differences, standard UNIX `diff(1)` is required.
- (recommended) `jb`: [#Jsonnet Bundler](#jsonnet-bundler), the Jsonnet package
  manager
- (recommended) `helm`: [Helm](https://helm.sh), required for [Helm
  support](/helm)

## Jsonnet Bundler

The [Jsonnet Bundler](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler) project creates a package manager for Jsonnet
to share and reuse code across the internet, similar to `npm` or `go mod`.

Tanka uses this tool by default, so it's recommended to install it as well:
