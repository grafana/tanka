# Kubernetes library

The last section has shown that using a library for creating Kubernetes objects
can drastically simplify the code you need to write. However, there is a huge
amount of different kinds of objects and the Kubernetes API is evolving (and
thus changing) quite rapidly.

Writing and maintaining such a library could be a full-time job on it's own.
Luckily, it is possible to generate such a library from the Kubernetes OpenAPI
specification! Even better, it has already been done for you.

## k8s-libsonnet

The library is called `k8s-libsonnet` (replacing the discontinued `ksonnet-lib`),
currently available at https://github.com/jsonnet-libs/k8s-libsonnet.

> **Note**: The `ksonnet` project has been abandoned, the library is not maintained
> anymore. However, the community backed by Grafana Labs has picked up on this with
> the `k8s-libsonnet` library.

As `k8s-libsonnet` has broken compatibility in a few places with `ksonnet-lib` (for good
reason), we have instrumented the widely used `ksonnet-util` library with a
compatibility layer to improve the developer and user experience:
https://github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/tree/master/ksonnet-util

If you do not have any strong reasons against it, just adopt the wrapper as
well, it will ease your work. Many of the original `ksonnet-util` enhancements
have already made their way into `k8s-libsonnet`.

The docs for `k8s-libsonnet` library can be found here:
https://jsonnet-libs.github.io/k8s-libsonnet/

## Installation

Like every other external library, `k8s-libsonnet` can be installed using
`jsonnet-bundler`.
However, Tanka already **did this for you** during [project
creation (`tk init`)](/tutorial/jsonnet#creating-a-new-project):

```bash
$ tk init
  └─ jb install github.com/jsonnet-libs/k8s-libsonnet/1.21@main github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/ksonnet-util

```

This created the following structure in `/vendor`:

```bash
vendor
├── github.com
│   ├── grafana
│   │   └── jsonnet-libs
│   │       └── ksonnet-util
│   │           ├── ...
│   │           └── kausal.libsonnet # Grafana's wrapper
│   └── jsonnet-libs
│       └── k8s-libsonnet
│           └── 1.21
│               ├── ...
│               └── main.libsonnet   # k8s-libsonnet entrypoint
├── 1.21 -> github.com/jsonnet-libs/k8s-libsonnet/1.21
└── ksonnet-util -> github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/ksonnet-util
```

> **Info**: The `vendor/` is the location for external libraries, while `lib/`
> can be used for your own ones. Check [import paths](/libraries/import-paths)
> for more information.

#### Aliasing
Because of how `jb` works, the library can be imported as
`github.com/jsonnet-libs/k8s-libsonnet/1.21/main.libsonnet`.  Most external
libraries (including our wrapper) expect it as a simple `k.libsonnet` (without
the package prefix).

To support both, Tanka automatically created an alias file for you:
`/lib/k.libsonnet` that just imports the actual library, exposing it under this
alternative name as well.

> **More information**:
> This works, because `import` behaves like copy-pasting. So the contents of
> `k8s-libsonnet/1.21` are "copied" into our new file, making them behave exactly the
> same.

## Using it

First we need to import it in `main.jsonnet`:

```diff
- local k = import "kubernetes.libsonnet";
+ local k = import "github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/ksonnet-util/kausal.libsonnet";
  local grafana = import "grafana.jsonnet";
  local prometheus = import "prometheus.jsonnet";
  { /* ... */ }
```

> **Note**: `ksonnet-util` imports literal `k.libsonnet`, so [aliasing](#aliasing) is
> a must here. This works, because `/lib` and `/vendor` are automatically searched
> for libraries, and `k.libsonnet` can be found in `/lib` due to aforementioned
> aliasing.

Now that we have installed the correct version, let's use it in
`/environments/default/grafana.jsonnet` instead of our own helper:

```jsonnet
local k = import "github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/ksonnet-util/kausal.libsonnet";

{
  // use locals to extract the parts we need
  local deploy = k.apps.v1.deployment,
  local container = k.core.v1.container,
  local port = k.core.v1.containerPort,
  local service = k.core.v1.service,
  // defining the objects:
  grafana: {
    // deployment constructor: name, replicas, containers
    deployment: deploy.new(name=$._config.grafana.name, replicas=1, containers=[
      // container constructor
      container.new($._config.grafana.name, "grafana/grafana")
      + container.withPorts( // add ports to the container
          [port.new("ui", $._config.grafana.port)] // port constructor
        ),
    ]),

    // instead of using a service constructor, our wrapper provides
    // a handy helper to automatically generate a service for a Deployment
    service: k.util.serv.util.serviceFor(self.deployment)
             + service.mixin.spec.withType("NodePort"),
  }
}
```

## Full example

Now that creating the individual objects does not take more than 5 lines, we can
merge it all back into a single file (`main.jsonnet`) and take a look at the
whole picture:

```jsonnet
local k = import "github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/ksonnet-util/kausal.libsonnet";

{
  _config:: {
    grafana: {
      port: 3000,
      name: "grafana",
    },
    prometheus: {
      port: 9090,
      name: "prometheus"
    }
  },

  local deployment = k.apps.v1.deployment,
  local container = k.core.v1.container,
  local port = k.core.v1.containerPort,
  local service = k.core.v1.service,

  prometheus: {
    deployment: deployment.new(
      name=$._config.prometheus.name, replicas=1,
      containers=[
        container.new($._config.prometheus.name, "prom/prometheus")
        + container.withPorts([port.new("api", $._config.prometheus.port)]),
      ],
    ),
    service: k.util.serviceFor(self.deployment),
  },
  grafana: {
    deployment: deployment.new(
      name=$._config.grafana.name, replicas=1,
      containers=[
        container.new($._config.grafana.name, "grafana/grafana")
        + container.withPorts([port.new("ui", $._config.grafana.port)]),
      ],
    ),
    service:
      k.util.serviceFor(self.deployment)
      + service.mixin.spec.withType("NodePort"),
  },
}
```

That's a pretty big improvement, considering how verbose and error-prone it was
before!
