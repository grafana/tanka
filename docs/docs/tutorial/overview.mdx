# Tutorial

## Learning how to use Tanka

Welcome to the Tanka tutorial!
The following sections will explain how to deploy an example stack,
([Grafana](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana) and
[Prometheus](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus)), to Kubernetes. We will also deal with parameters, differences between `dev` and `prod` and how to stop worrying and love libraries.

To do so, we have the following steps:

1. [Deploying **without** Tanka first](/tutorial/refresher): Using good old `kubectl` to understand what Tanka will do for us.
2. [Using Jsonnet](/tutorial/jsonnet): Doing the same thing once again, but this time with Tanka and Jsonnet.
3. [Parameterizing](/tutorial/parameters): Using Variables to avoid data duplication.
4. [Abstraction](/tutorial/abstraction): Splitting components into individual parts.
5. [Environments](/tutorial/environments): Dealing with differences between `dev` and `prod`.
6. [`k.libsonnet`](/tutorial/k-lib): Avoid having to remember API resources.

Completing this gives a solid knowledge of Tanka's fundamentals. Let's get started!
