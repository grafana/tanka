# Inline environments

Inline environments is the practice of defining the environment's config inline
for evaluation at runtime as opposed to configuring it statically in
`spec.json`.

The general take away is:

* `spec.json` will no longer be used
* `main.jsonnet` is expected to render a `tanka.dev/Environment` object
* this object is expected to hold Kubernetes objects at `.data`

## Converting to an inline environment

Converting a traditional `spec.json` environment into an inline environment is quite
straight forward. Based on the example from [Using Jsonnet](tutorial/jsonnet):

The directory structure:

```sh
├── environments
│   └── default # default environment
│       ├── main.jsonnet # main file
│       └── spec.json # environment's config
├── jsonnetfile.json
├── lib # libraries
└── vendor # external libraries
```

The original files look like this:

```jsonnet
// main.jsonnet
{
  some_deployment: {/* ... */ },
  some_service: {/* ... */ },
}
```


```json
// spec.json
{
  "apiVersion": "tanka.dev/v1alpha1",
  "kind": "Environment",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "default"
  },
  "spec": {
    "apiServer": "https://127.0.0.1:6443",
    "namespace": "monitoring"
  }
}
```

Converting is a simple as bringing in the `spec.json` into `main.jsonnet` and
moving the original `main.jsonnet` scope into the `data:` element.

```jsonnet
// main.jsonnet
{
  apiVersion: 'tanka.dev/v1alpha1',
  kind: 'Environment',
  metadata: {
    name: 'default',
  },
  spec: {
    apiServer: 'https://127.0.0.1:6443',
    namespace: 'monitoring',
  },
  data: { // original main.jsonnet data
    some_deployment: {/* ... */ },
    some_service: {/* ... */ },
  },
}
```


## Use case: variable apiServer

Even though the `apiServer` directive is originally meant to prevent that the
manifests don't get accidentally applied to the wrong Kubernetes cluster, there
is a valid use case for making the `apiServer` variable: Local test clusters.

Instead of modifying `spec.json` each time, with inline environments it is
possible to leverage powerful jsonnet concepts, for example with top level
arguments:

```jsonnet
// environments/minikube-test-setup/main.jsonnet
function(apiServer) {
  apiVersion: 'tanka.dev/v1alpha1',
  kind: 'Environment',
  metadata: {
    name: 'minikube-test-setup',
  },
  spec: {
    apiServer: apiServer,
    namespace: 'monitoring',
  },
  data: { /* ... */ },
}
```

Applying this to a local Kubernetes cluster can be done like this:

```bash
$ tk apply --tla-str apiServer=https://127.0.0.1:4758 environments/minikube-test-setup
```

Similarly this can be used to configure any part of the Environment object, like
`namespace:`, `metadata.labels`, ...

## Caveats

### `import "tk"`

Inline environments cannot use [`import "tk"`](config#jsonnet-access) anymore as
this information was populated before jsonnet evaluation by the existence of
`spec.json`.

### `tk env`

The different `tk env` subcommands are heavily based on the `spec.json`
approach. `tk env list` will continue to work as expected, `tk env
(add|remove|set)` will only work for `spec.json` based environments.

### Multiple inline environments

Having multiple inline environments is currently unsupported during Kubernetes
operations, with an exception for `tk eval`, which will happily render it to
json.
