# Kustomize Support

[Kustomize](https://kustomize.io) provides a solution for customizing Kubernetes
manifests in YAML.

Even though Grafana Tanka uses the [Jsonnet language](/jsonnet/overview) for
resource definition, you can still consume kustomizations, as described below.

> **Warning:** Keep in mind this feature is considered EXPERIMENTAL

## Consuming a Kustomization from Jsonnet

Kustomize support is provided using the
[`github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/tanka-util`](https://github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/tree/master/tanka-util)
library.  Install it with:

```bash
jb install github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/tanka-util
```

The following example shows how to extract the individual resources of the
[`flux2/source-controller`](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/tree/main/manifests/bases/source-controller)
kustomization:

```jsonnet
local tanka = import 'github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/tanka-util/main.libsonnet';
local kustomize = tanka.kustomize.new(std.thisFile);

{
  source_controller: kustomize.build(path='flux2')
}
```

Kustomize takes a kustomization manifest as input. Go on an create this file
`flux2/kustomization.yaml` relative to above jsonnet:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/archive/v0.4.3.zip//flux2-0.4.3/manifests/bases/source-controller
```

> **Important:** You MUST include the `.new(std.thisFile)` part in the import.
> This is what tells Tanka where you actually call `kustomize.build()` from, so
> it can find your kustomization manifest.

<br />

Once invoked, the `$.source_controller` key holds the individual resources of
the kustomization as a regular Jsonnet object that looks roughly like so:

```jsonnet
{
  'custom_resource_definition_buckets.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io': {/* ... */ },
  'custom_resource_definition_gitrepositories.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io': {/* ... */ },
  'custom_resource_definition_helmcharts.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io': {/* ... */ },
  'custom_resource_definition_helmrepositories.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io': {/* ... */ },
  deployment_source_controller: {/* ... */ },
  service_source_controller: {/* ... */ },
}
```

Above can be [manipulated](/tutorial/environments#patching) in the same way as
any other Jsonnet data.

## Working with Kustomize

Tanka, like Jsonnet, is hermetic. It **always yields the same resources** when
the project is strictly self-contained.

Kustomize however has the ability to pull
[resources](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/resource/)
from different sources at runtime, which violates above requirement. This is
also apparent in the example above.

> **Important:** Due to the nature of Kustomize, it is not feasible to ensure
> hermetic and reproducible kustomize builds from within Tanka. Beware of that
> when using Kustomize.

## Troubleshooting

### Kustomize executable missing

Kustomize support in Tanka requires the `kustomize` binary installed on your
system and available on the `$PATH`. If Kustomize is not installed, you will see
this error message:

```
evaluating jsonnet: RUNTIME ERROR: Expanding Kustomize: exec: "kustomize": executable file not found in $PATH
```

To solve this, you need to 
[install Kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/).
If you cannot install it system-wide, you can point Tanka at your executable 
using [`TANKA_KUSTOMIZE_PATH`](/env-vars#tanka_kustomize_path)

### opts.calledFrom unset

This occurs, when Tanka was not told where it `kustomize.build()` was invoked
from. This most likely means you didn't call `new(std.thisFile)` when importing `tanka-util`:

```jsonnet
local tanka = import "github.com/grafana/jsonnet-libs/tanka-util/main.libsonnet";
local helm = tanka.helm.new(std.thisFile);
                       ↑ This is important
```

### Failed to find kustomization

```
helmTemplate: Failed to find a kustomization at 'flux2': No such file or directory.
helmTemplate: Failed to find a kustomization at '/home/user/stuff/tanka/environments/default/flux2': No such file or directory.
```

Tanka failed to locate your kustomization on the filesystem. It looked at the
relative path you provided in `kustomize.build()`, starting from the directory
of the file you called `kustomize.build()` from.

Please check there is actually a valid kustomization at this place.
