# Directory Structure

Tanka works with a minimal set of assumptions on its environment. Unlike tools
such as `ksonnet`, it does expect code to be placed in strictly named directories.

Instead, it relies on two directories to find your code:

### Root Directory (`rootDir`)
The `rootDir` marks the start of a directory tree that represents a Tanka
project. It behaves similar to a `git` repository:  
A marker file
([`jsonnetfile.json`](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler), like
git has its `.git/`) indicates the beginning of the tree. Regardless of how deep
you are in it, Tanka can always discover the project by searching for a
`jsonnetfile.json` in the parent directories.

### Base Directory (`baseDir`)
The base directory is the directory that contains a file called `main.jsonnet`.
This file is used as the entrypoint for evaluating `.jsonnet` to `.yaml`.  
The `baseDir` *must* be in the tree of the `rootDir` or the `rootDir` itself
(i.e. `jsonnetfile.json` and `main.jsonnet` in the same directory).

??? example "Example: Minimal"
    In this example, `rootDir` and `baseDir` are the same.
    ```tree
    .
    ├── jsonnetfile.json
    ├── lib/
    ├── main.jsonnet
    └── vendor/
    ```
    
??? example "Example: Environments"
    To enable a behavior close to what `ksonnet` used to call an *Environment*,
    multiple `baseDirs` can be created in sub-directories.

    ```tree
    .
    ├── environments
    │   ├── dev
    │   │   └── main.jsonnet
    │   └── prod
    │       └── main.jsonnet
    ├── jsonnetfile.json
    ├── lib/
    └── vendor/
    ```

## Import paths
There are three places, imported files can come from:

#### Relative
Imports may be relative to the current file. Use a relative path (`import "./whatever.jsonnet"`) for this.

#### Library (`rootDir/lib`)
If a folder called `lib` exists in `rootDir`, imports from here are possible as well.

Place code here, that is used multiple times across this project. However, when
this code needs to be re-used across project boundaries, consider moving it into
its own Git repository and vendor it in using [Jsonnet bundler](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler).

#### Vendor (`rootDir/vendor`)
The purpose `vendor` folder is to hold *shared* libraries, that are downloaded
using a package manager.

!!! warning
    This folder shall be managed by
    [Jsonnet bundler](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler) or
    another comparable tool. **Do not** modify the files in here by hand. Change
    them on the remote if required.

### Precedence
The most specific import takes precedence:

1. Relative import
2. Local library (`lib/`)
2. Shared library (`vendor/`)

The higher an import appears in this list, the more likely it is taken.
