Tanka is distributed as a single binary called `tk`. It already includes the Jsonnet compiler, but requires some tools to be available:

- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/): Tanka
  uses `kubectl` to communicate to your cluster. This means `kubectl` must be
  available somewhere on your `$PATH`. If you ever have worked with Kubernetes
  before, this should be the case anyways.
- `diff`: To compute differences, standard UNIX `diff(1)` is required.
- (recommended) `jb`: [#Jsonnet Bundler](#jsonnet-bundler), the Jsonnet package
  manager
- (recommended) `helm`: [Helm](https://helm.sh), required for [Helm
  support](/helm)

## Tanka

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
<TabItem label="MacOS">
On macOS, Tanka is best installed using [`brew`](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install tanka
```

This downloads the most recent version of Tanka and installs it.
Also, Tanka is automatically kept up to date as part of `brew upgrade`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="ArchLinux">

We maintain two AUR packages, one building [from source](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tanka/) and another one using
a [pre-compiled binary](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tanka-bin/).

These can be installed using any AUR helper, e.g. [`yay`](https://github.com/Jguer/yay):

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="From Source">
```bash
yay tanka
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Using pre-compiled binaries">

```bash
yay tanka-bin
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Binary">
For all other operating systems, we provide pre-compiled binaries for 
Tanka at [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/grafana/tanka/releases).

Just grab the latest version from there, download it and put somewhere in your `$PATH` (e.g. to `/usr/local/bin/tk`)

#### Linux, macOS

For Linux and macOS, download the binary for your architecture, put it somewhere on your `$PATH`, and make it an executable:

<Tabs syncKey="subplatform">
<TabItem label="Linux amd64">
```bash
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/tk https://github.com/grafana/tanka/releases/latest/download/tk-linux-amd64
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/tk
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Linux arm / arm64 (e.g. RaspberryPi)">

```bash
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/tk https://github.com/grafana/tanka/releases/latest/download/tk-linux-arm
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/tk https://github.com/grafana/tanka/releases/latest/download/tk-linux-arm64
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/tk
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">

```bash
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/tk https://github.com/grafana/tanka/releases/latest/download/tk-darwin-amd64
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/tk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Go">
If you happen to have a local [Go](https://golang.org) toolchain, you can also build Tanka from source using `go install`:

```bash
cd /tmp
go install github.com/grafana/tanka/cmd/tk@latest
```

If that does not work for whatever reason (Go modules, etc), clone and compile manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grafana/tanka
cd tanka
make install
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Jsonnet Bundler

The [Jsonnet Bundler](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler) project creates a package manager for Jsonnet
to share and reuse code across the internet, similar to `npm` or `go mod`.

Tanka uses this tool by default, so it's recommended to install it as well:

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
<TabItem label="MacOS">
On macOS, Jsonnet Bundler is best installed using [`brew`](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install jsonnet-bundler
```

This downloads the most recent version of Jsonnet Bundler and installs it.  
Also, Jsonnet Bundler is automatically kept up to date as part of `brew upgrade`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="ArchLinux">
On ArchLinux, install using the [`jsonnet-bundler-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/jsonnet-bundler-bin/) AUR package:

```bash
yay jsonnet-bundler-bin
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Binary">
The `jb` binary is primarily distributed using [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/releases).

##### Linux, macOS

For Linux and macOS, download the binary for your architecture, put it somewhere on your `$PATH`, and make it an executable:

<Tabs syncKey="subplatform">
<TabItem label="Linux amd64">
```bash
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/jb https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/releases/latest/download/jb-linux-amd64

```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Linux arm / arm64 (e.g. RaspberryPi)">

```bash
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/jb https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/releases/latest/download/jb-linux-arm
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/jb https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/releases/latest/download/jb-linux-arm64
