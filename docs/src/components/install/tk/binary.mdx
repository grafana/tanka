For all other operating systems, we provide pre-compiled binaries for Tanka at
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/grafana/tanka/releases).

Just grab the latest version from there, download it and put somewhere in your
`$PATH` (e.g. to `/usr/local/bin/tk`)

#### Linux, macOS

For Linux and macOS, download the binary for your architecture, put it somewhere on your `$PATH`, and make it an executable:

```bash
# Linux amd64:
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/tk https://github.com/grafana/tanka/releases/latest/download/tk-linux-amd64
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/tk

# Linux arm / arm64 (e.g. RaspberryPi):
