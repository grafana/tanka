We maintain two AUR packages, one building [from
source](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tanka/) and another one using a
[pre-compiled binary](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tanka-bin/).

These can be installed using any AUR helper, e.g. [`yay`](https://github.com/Jguer/yay):

```bash
# from source:
$ yay tanka

# using pre-compiled binary:
$ yay tanka-bin
```
