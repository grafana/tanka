If you happen to have a local [Go](https://golang.org) toolchain, you can also build Tanka from source using `go get`:

```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/grafana/tanka/cmd/tk
```

If that does not work for whatever reason (Go modules, etc), clone and compile manually:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/grafana/tanka
$ cd tanka
$ make install
```
